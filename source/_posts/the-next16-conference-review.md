<span class="s1">How many conferences [<span class="s2">open</span>](https://twitter.com/NathalieNahai/status/778869573248544768%0A) with a [<span class="s2">techno marching band</span>](http://www.meute.eu/)? As far as I know there’s only one. And that’s the [<span class="s2">Next Conference</span>](http://nextconf.eu/), it’s part of the [<span class="s2">Reeperbahn Festival</span>](https://www.reeperbahnfestival.com/en/frontpage) in Hamburg.</span>

<span class="s1">I'm reviewing some of the keynotes and feeling inspired by the amazing lineup of speakers which were complemented with a splattering of soul touching music.</span>

<span class="s1">For shear stage presence I’d give the award to [<span class="s2">Steve Blame</span>](https://www.reeperbahnfestival.com/de/speaker/stephen-james). He appeared 3 times a day to promote a band. Letting some music intersperse and add some perspective to the depth of technical and digital trends that were being talked about. He walked onto the stage in a relaxed and calm manner, giving entertaining anecdotes while the acts setup their instruments. If you want to see how you to introduce a band then look no further.</span>

<span class="s1">The Next Conference’s tag line is **“Celebrating Digital Life”** It’s the perfect stepping stone for developers who want to take a step back and view things from a different perspective. There are no coding sessions. Instead it’s a view of how technology trends are affecting the world. We’re talking big picture. It helps put things in context.</span>

<span class="s1">Apart from the music my favourite talks were by [<span class="s2">David Mattin </span>](http://trendwatching.com/people/david-mattin/)and [<span class="s2">Claire Burge</span>](http://claireburge.com/).</span>

<span class="s1">Here’s my take on their talks:</span>

*   [<span class="s1">Trendwatching 2017 by David Mattin</span>](http://leadtechie.com/?p=95)
*   [<span class="s1">The Future of Work is Chaos by Claire Burge</span>](http://leadtechie.com/?p=92)

<span class="s1">I hope to see you at next year at [<span class="s2">NEXT17</span>](https://nextconf.eu/apply-for-next17/)</span>
