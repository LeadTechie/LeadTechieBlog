<span class="s1">[David Mattin](https://twitter.com/dmattin)</span><span class="s2">’s company [Trendwatching](http://trendwatching.com/) does the research so that you can enjoy a perfectly sculpted story and overview of the [<span class="s1">trends</span>](https://nextconf.eu/2016/09/next16-david-mattin-five-trends-change-business/) that are currently taking place. His slides are available [<span class="s1">here</span>](http://www.slideshare.net/sinnerschrader/trendwatching-2017).</span>

One of his top trends is Motivated Mindlessness. “Consumers, accustomed to AI-fueled assistance, seek to outsource the will power, planning and coaching needed to self-improve”

<span class="s2">I think this makes it sounds a little negative, almost like people are getting lazier. I’d like to think of this more positively. There are now a whole host of scientifically proven tricks, which have been turned into consumer products and services, that help people improve themselves.</span>

<span class="s2">Are you supercharging yourself? Compared to the past this is now a lot easier to do.</span>

<span class="s2">I think I’d rather call it “Supported Mindfulness” Lot’s of people have great ideas on how they can improve themselves. The trouble is that there’s always something that’s getting in the way. Google has joined the trend and launched [<span class="s1">features</span>](https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/12/google-calendar-goals/) to help you. If you look at the massive growth of other focussed start-ups like [<span class="s1">coach.me</span>](file:///var/folders/n_/mdn6_kq53g3383_5957_3px80000gq/T/com.soulmen.ulysses3/0c741cda37cc45cdaaa1612f4e105240/The%20NEXT16%20Conference%20Review/coach.me) you can see that this trend is well and truly underway.</span>
