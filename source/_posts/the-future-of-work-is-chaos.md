<span class="s1">[Claire Burge](http://claireburge.com/)</span><span class="s4"> did two talks. [<span class="s3">How AI will transform the way we work</span>](http://www.slideshare.net/sinnerschrader/human-20-how-ai-will-transform-the-way-we-work) and [<span class="s3">The future of work is chaos</span>](http://www.slideshare.net/sinnerschrader/the-future-of-work-is-chaos).</span>

<span class="s5">They had overlapping themes, my main takeaways are:</span>

<span class="s5">Humans are good at Critical Thinking and Creativity. Anything else can be automated and will be done by AI. Why fight it, embrace it. Can you optimise and plan meetings for multiple teams and departments? It may take you time now but it’s really a waste of time, delegate it to the future AI bot that will soon be supporting you. You should be concentrating on the important stuff.</span>

<span class="s5">There is one image that sticks in my head, and that’s the analogy regarding playgrounds. As a father of two kids it sits well with me. I always thought of playgrounds as a place for kids to go crazy, somewhere where they can be out of control, somewhere were they can let their energy out.</span>

<span class="s5">Claire’s view, which I now see, is that they are extremely controlled environments. They generally have fences to stop the kids escaping. They have multiple and very different specific areas. Swings to swing on, slides to climb up (yes, because sliding down would be boring) and a climbing frame to climb on etc. The question today is “What are we doing to setup the equivalent environments in our workplaces?”</span>

<span class="s1">[_“You don't need to tell a child to go and play - the space tells them that. But the controls all exists in the design of the space. Apply that to AI and it gets really, really powerful.”_](http://nextconf.eu/2016/09/next16-ai-brings-humans-2-0-work/)</span>

<span class="s5">Claire also talked about major change projects. She split them into three areas:</span>

*   <span class="s5">Leadership</span>
*   <span class="s5">Processes</span>
*   <span class="s5">People</span>

<span class="s5">Most mistakes are made by focussing only on the processes. Unless the leadership and people are involved then you’re never going to reach more than 30% of the impact that’s possible. This means don’t jump straight into processes. You need to make sure that the leadership deeply understands the what, why and how regarding the changes.</span>

<span class="s5">I’d like to end it with Claire’s advice:</span>

**<span class="s5">“Do we tame the chaos? No. We embrace it. That's the challenge.”</span>**
