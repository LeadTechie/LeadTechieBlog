The buzz of the [<span class="s2">conference</span>](http://www.tedxfrankfurt.de/) is over. The excitement and energy have faded. A few questions remain. What did I learn? How will it help me? How will it help others? What will I now do differently?

<span class="s1">Well first of all. TEDxFrankfurt was a great success. A great opening from [<span class="s2">Simon Anholt</span>](https://twitter.com/SimonAnholt). An outlandish demo from [<span class="s2">Greg Gage</span>](https://twitter.com/phineasgreg) (even if it was verging on animal cruelty). A perfect ending from [<span class="s2">Benita Matofska</span>](https://twitter.com/benitamatofska).</span>

<span class="s1">It was refreshing to see Simon ask **“What happens when the whole world votes?”** Well, you can find the answer on the [Global Vote website](https://goodcountry.org/global-vote). With a globalised economy we are interdependent. Now more than ever before. Our decisions affect others and their decisions us. So why do we still use a voting system which is optimised for an us vs them attitude.</span>

The real question is **_“Are you looking inwards and backwards?”_** Unfortunately probably too many people are. That’s likely because they find comfort there. The better alternative is the challenge **_“Are you looking outwards and forwards?”_**

<span class="s3">[MarieMarie](https://www.facebook.com/mariemariemusic/)</span><span class="s1"> serenaded us at the break, the subtle tones of the harp in sharp contrast to the shrieks from [<span class="s2">Greg’s</span>](https://twitter.com/phineasgreg) talk. It really was needed to calm the nerves. Greg was there with his do it yourself kit to get kids interested in neuroscience. If you’re interested in what he did then look at his previous TED talk [<span class="s2">here</span>](https://www.ted.com/talks/greg_gage_how_to_control_someone_else_s_arm_with_your_brain) or his experiment [<span class="s2">here</span>](https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/somatotopy).</span>

<span class="s1">The event closed with the “Secret of the Sharing Economy” Benita delivered her plea for us to share more. She listed the benefits both financially and environmentally. Check out more [<span class="s2">here</span>](http://www.thepeoplewhoshare.com/the-share-collection/). But she took it a step further to the emotional level:</span>

**<span class="s1">_“When you trust someone, something wonderful can happen"_</span>**

<span class="s1">So, how do I look outwards and forwards? How do I trust someone so that something wonderful can happen?</span>

<span class="s1">These are very interesting questions to ponder. Especially as I was fortunate enough to be watching the event live. There seemed to be a certain amount of irony. World class speakers wanting to change the world. But the audience in a comfortable bubble, a 5 star hotel.</span>

<span class="s1">These events are inspirational, but they need to inspire real action. The energy in the room was great. But will we as the audience remain passive. We shouldn’t attend such talks just to sit back and relax.</span>

<span class="s1">So, what about outwards and forwards, what about making something wonderful happen for someone else?</span>

<span class="s1">Well, I thought about it and found an answer. It’s time I **shared** some of my money. Time to trust a budding entrepreneur who needs some support. So I made some more loans on [<span class="s2">Kiva</span>](file:///var/folders/n_/mdn6_kq53g3383_5957_3px80000gq/T/com.soulmen.ulysses3/4eedf39e73564cb6adb3272b268919be/TEDx%20Frankfurt%202016%20Review/www.kiva.org). It’s not a donation, it’s loan, it’s a massive enabler. It’s helping to kick start something special.</span>

<span class="s1">**“When you trust someone, something wonderful can happen"** I hope in a few months these businesses will be starting up. They will be giving meaningful work to the entrepreneur. They will be helping their local communities.</span>

<span class="s1">Thank you [<span class="s2">Simon</span>](https://twitter.com/SimonAnholt) and [<span class="s2">Benita</span>](https://twitter.com/benitamatofska). For the inspiration. For reminding me to look outwards and forwards and to trust someone.</span>
