It’s often said that more choice is better. To a certain extent choice is good, but **removing options can help focus and productivity**.

Have you heard of an [Acrostic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrostic)? It’s a word I hadn’t come across for a long time. It’s a simple concept though. The first letter of each line spells out a word or message. Here’s an example...

I’d been thinking about the topics for further articles on this blog and at the same time I had a million ideas but nothing concrete. Adding the constraints that come with an acrostic helped me focus and I got this draft list finished in 5 minutes.

So, the things to think about…

1.  Too many options? Are you in “analysis paralysis”? Think about **how you could add constraints**. eg if you only had 1 day rather than 1 week. What would you deliver?
2.  As a leader it’s your job to get the best out of your team. Your team needs freedom to work, but too many options may make them uncertain. **Could you be more specific or clearer? ie add some helpful constraints for them.**
3.  Adding constraints may block off some options. If this improves your decision making speed it’s probably worth the trade off. eg **It’s better to move forward with the 80% solution than it is to think about the perfect solution and never start.**
